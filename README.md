To try it out yourself:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/fabiancdng/Snake
```

2. `cd` into it:
```
cd Snake/
```

3. Install dependencies:
```
npm i
```

4. Build JavaScript from source code:
```
npm run build
```

5. Optional Use `serve` (`npm i -g serve`) to serve assets locally:
```
serve
```

Alternatively, you can only run `npm run build` to compile the TypeScript files and then throw the `dist/` folder alongside the `index.html` file and the `assets/` folder onto a real web server.
